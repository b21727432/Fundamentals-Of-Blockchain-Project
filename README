TAXİ BUSİNESS ASSİGNMENT

Ali Kayadibi

	In this project I made a business where we collect money from participants, buy a taxi from car dealer
and run this taxi with a taxi driver.Participants gives money to manager and manager deals with these kind of 
things.After collecting money  car dealer proposes a car, participants vote for that car if we get majority we buy
this car, manager pays to dealer.After that we select driver but participants must approve driver.If we approve using
majority we set the driver and he starts working.He runs taxi for us and we pay salary to him.After some time we share
what we learned so far between participants.We subtract taxi driver's salary and divide whats left between participants.
We also have functions in case where car dealer might want to buy taxi from us.In that case dealer proposes a price for
taxi, we ask for participants if we get majority we sell that car and we got cars money.We can also fire driver in that
case we give full salary and fire him.
	I mostly used structs because there are lots of objects with unique attributes in that case.I also used if voted,
if participant kind of structures to prevent some security leaks.With transfer function i was able to send money from contract
to dealer.Others can send money to contract by payable function.
